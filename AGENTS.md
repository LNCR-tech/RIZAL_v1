# Repository Instructions

- For every backend code change under `backend/`, update the documentation in `docs/backend/`.
- Update any affected backend guide with the changed logic, routes, schemas, models, migrations, or configuration.
- If a backend change affects runtime behavior, document how to test it.
- Do not implement hardcoded answers or preset question-to-answer mappings for chat. Responses must be generated from model reasoning based on the user's prompt and available context.
- for every changes made do git add -A, git commit -m. you decide whatever commit message to say. then git push
- if a git push doesn't work, git pull --rebase and fix if there are any merge conflicts, ask the user which one to pick, then git push again
- When git merging, ensure that ONLY the `pilot` branch has the `seeder/` folder. It MUST NOT be present in `preproduction` or `production` branches.
- **frontend-app/ is READ-ONLY — do NOT edit any file inside `frontend-app/`. It is the APK source and can only be reviewed. Only `backend/` files may be edited.**

## Endpoint Discovery Rule (MANDATORY)

- **Before suggesting a new endpoint or modifying an existing one, ALWAYS grep/search the entire `backend/` codebase first to check if a suitable endpoint already exists.**
- Search `backend/app/routers/`, `backend/app/reports/`, and router files for the needed data shape.
- Only propose creating or modifying an endpoint if no existing endpoint satisfies the requirement.
- If an existing endpoint returns the needed data, point to it directly — do NOT create a duplicate.
